The data file contains one trace obtained from a golgi cell by using current clamp. The file contains the time as well. The cell was excited by a short(0.5ms,250pA) and by a long(500ms,12pA) pulse, so you have to use the provided stimuli file (for this, select the "Custom Waveform" option from the dropdown menu on the stimuli layer and then load the file).
The data trace is 1200ms long and the sampling frequency was 20kHz.

Test With Surrogate:
The data file has one trace, which is 1000 ms long and the sampling frequency was 40kHz.
The data file also contains the time and was obtained from the corresponding model by using an IClamp (connected to the middle (0.5) of the soma) with the following parameters:
stim.del=100
stim.dur=500
stim.amp=0.5

The following model parameters were set (the others are default):
gnabar_hh=0.4
gkbar_hh=0.02
g_pas=0.001

Layer 2

On the second layer the user can specify the simulator which can be
Neuron or external.
If the user decided to use Neuron as the simulator then the model file
must contain only the necessary
structure and mechanisms. The model can be loaded simply after selecting
the model file and the
special folder where the necessary .mod files are located (optional).
As Neuron can not load it's .dlls after startup, if the special files
were not found, the software must be
restarted. Once the model is loaded successfully, the content of the
model will be displayed, and the
user can select the parameters by picking them int the list and pressing
the “set” button. Removing a
parameter is done in a similar fashion.
At this point the user can load or define a special function which
carries out different tasks during the
optimization.

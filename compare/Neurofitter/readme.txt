To run the examples, you must install Neurofitter first. Then you have to edit the following tags in the corresponding .xml file:
ModelDirectory: The directory where the model file is located
OutputDirectory: The directoy where the model creates its output
ModelSource: The path of the model
ParameterFile: The path and the name of the file where Neurofitter writes the parameters
FilesDirectory: Directory containing the input file

The optimization can be started by the "neurofitter-0.9.3/bin/neurofitter path_to_file/example.xml" command
